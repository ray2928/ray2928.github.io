Great speakers and some technologies really dazzles me


### Stream and Lambda Expression in Java 8:

Stream and Lambda expression are very interesting. By refactoring using these, I can imagine that many lines of code can be shortened. May be there is some other performance benefit using Java 8.

The speaker also recommend Java.time to handle date and time in project, which is something to look at.

### Optimized your memory:

The speaker is very funny and tried to tell us how to memorize 25 unrelated words in 3 minutes.

At first I was only able to memorize 7 words. And then he told us we can easily remember all the words by creating a very absurd image between two words. By doing so, most of us can memorize 25 words in 3 minutes!

### Java Memory and Garbage Collection:

I learned that the mechanism of garbage collection in java is mark and sweep.

Mark is check all the object to see if they have reference, and those who do not have reference will be swept during garbage collection.

### React.js

Sounds very interesting to use it to develop web app. I need more investigation to say anything about it.

### High performance of a web app

Fun fact: google uses load time to do page rank.

A trick to increase your load speed: load your main content first and then the ads and other stuff.

Three measuring websites:

  1. AKAIMIMOBITEST.COM
  2. SPEEDGUN.io
  3. YELLOWLAB.COM
